BARQODE:
-Research Summary:
My goal was to determine if features like social sharing, mobile payments, and money transfers could be effectively integrated into a retro arcade setting.

To understand how modern mobile technology could enhance the arcade experience, I interviewed 5 adults aged 25-50 who regularly use mobile devices for social interactions, payments, and planning group activities.

RESEARCH RESULTS:
My user study identified the following key pain points:

Purchase Flexibility: Users desire the option to purchase either game tokens or digital game credits.
Token Distribution: Frequent players and groups find distributing tokens cumbersome.
Activity Tracking: stat nerds lack a way to track their arcade habits and high scores.

COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

A comparison of 4 local and national arcade venues revealed variations in pay systems, mobile apps, and rewards programs.

Dave & Busterâ€™s: Offers a convenient Power Card for rewards but lacks social sharing features.
EightyTwo: Focuses on adult-oriented gaming but lacks a mobile app or rewards system.
Lucky Strike Lanes: Prioritizes bowling and family-friendly entertainment, with limited arcade features.
Neon Retro Arcade: Provides an all-you-can-play model but caters to a younger demographic and lacks an online presence.


Opportunities

Hybrid Payment: Offer both digital mobile payments and a token system.
Gamer Rewards: Implement a rewards program that allows users to earn points off-site.
Responsive Website: Ensure the website is fully responsive and offers the same functionality as the mobile app.
